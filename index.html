    Dear Design Student

    <!-- this is the article heading -->
    100% Clever, 0% Hired

    <!-- this is the article subheading/teaser -->
    Resumés are communication documents that gain nothing from the addition of
    sparkles, graphs, and your little big data

    <!-- this is the question -->
    Q: So I have started seeing this in a lot in designer portfolios and resumes
    recently. A candidate will have a title that says “My Skills”, and below are
    bar graphs that are in percentages. What do the percentages mean? If you say
    Photoshop: 85%, does that mean you know 85% of all there is to know about
    Photoshop? Is this even a good way to represent this? I’m afraid it makes no
    sense to me.

    <!-- main copy (running text) begins here -->
    “Photoshop: 85%,” this makes 0% sense to me which is to say, none-at-all.
    And since when in the hell is Photoshop a skill?
    <!---->
    In the last 25 years, I have personally reviewed hundreds of applications,
    resumes, and portfolios. As I recall, the “percentages” started appearing
    around the time Nicolas Felton started to publish ********(add this link to
    'annual reports' http://feltron.com/)******** annual reports with visualized
    data on all facets of his life in 2004. A year or two later young persons,
    fresh out of school, started trying to make their resumes stand out by
    visualizing their data, even when it meant making things up.
    <!---->
    There are two problems with this. First, trying to communicate something as
    a percentage of 100 without any context. Second, mistaking tools with
    skills — likely to fill in for a lack of experience (that’s how it comes
    across to an employer). For the sake of discussion, let’s take on the first
    problem and try to apply a percentage of knowledge to something broader:
    walking.
    <!---->
    I don’t know exactly when I started to walk upright, but I’ll take a stab
    and say that I have 43 years of experience in walking. That’s a lot of time
    on two feet, but that doesn’t mean I know everything about walking. For
    instance, I have no experience in speed walking. Walking up hills is an
    activity I try to avoid. Growing up in Alaska, I spent a lot of time walking
    in snow, but not ********(use this link for 'all types of snow'
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_snow)******** all types of snow. I’ve
    spent time on a treadmill, but not enough that I can coach someone to
    improve their level of competency. I could go on. So where does that leave
    me in communicating my experience in walking as a percentage of the total?
    Nowhere.
    <!---->
    This is exactly where you get when trying to enumerate the fractional
    knowledge of a skill. Even with my decades of experience, don’t take my word
    for it. As soon as I came across this question, I took this problem to the
    recruiting team at ********(use this link for 'IBM Design'
    http://www.ibm.com/design/)******** IBM Design. This group evaluates
    thousands of applications, resumes, and portfolios each month. I asked what
    they thought about resumes that tried to convey experience as percentages,
    and I got gnarled, annoyed, confused, faces. “I hate that,” said one member
    of the team, “because I have no idea what it means.”
    <!---->
    Knowing their distaste for resume visualization, I inquired what format they
    preferred, and they replied with the tried and true triad of “beginner,
    intermediate, or expert.”
    <!---->
    You may think this boring, but percentages are simply not the best way for
    anyone to report their skill level. Looking for clear guidelines, I headed
    to good ole Monster, which has processed millions of applications. Here are
    their guidelines for rating skill levels:
    <!---->
    Beginner: A novice understanding of the skill. You have exposure to the
    skill and understand its basic concepts but lack experience.

    <!---->Intermediate: Between a beginner and an expert. You have experience
    with and can carry out the skill but don’t understand its advanced concepts.

    <!---->Expert: A highly developed skill level. You have solid experience and
    training with the skill and understand advanced concepts. You demonstrate
    proficiency and superior skill level.

    <!---->
    In an era of non-stop data visualization, it’s easy for designers to get
    caught up in trying to design everything, but it only works in the context
    of what needs to be communicated and how it needs to be conveyed. Otherwise,
    you’ll end up being this guy and that’s no bueno.

    <!---->
    Let’s move on to listing Photoshop as a skill. Yucky — don’t do it. Stating
    that you are an expert in Photoshop doesn’t tell me anything about your
    skill as a designer. It only tells me that you know how the application
    works, and knowing tools does not make you a designer. Here’s more practical
    knowledge from Monster:
    <!---->
    Job-related and transferable skills are the most desirable to list on your
    resume. For each skill, indicate your skill level and years of experience.
    <!---->
    The people who hire designers want to understand what you know how to do,
    your level of competency, and how long you’ve been doing it. How well can
    you select and set type? Can you design for email and for how long? What is
    your level of competency in editorial design? There are many straightforward
    ways to promote skill levels, and they are fundamentally more important than
    reading your knowledge of applications.
    <!---->
    Warning: Trying to be clever with “design” will only get in the way of your
    objectives. Whether applying for a job or delivering client work, apply
    design only when and where it’s appropriate. When applying for work there
    are better ways to stand out from the pack like solid typesetting, a
    well-written cover letter, and demonstrating that you can use design when
    and where it’s needed. Remember that expressing an idea in words is a vital
    core design skill. And check your spelling and grammar, because bad writing
    leads to deleted resumes 100% of the time, every time.
